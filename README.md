# Oauth2
Implementing Oauth2 authorization
### Here i have developed an application such that if my end user wants to access my api there is a condition that if he is a valid google user then he can enter the google credentials and after authorizing the credentials google oauth2 server will generate a token.By using that token he can access my API.
